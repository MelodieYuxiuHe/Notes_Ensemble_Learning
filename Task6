Model evaluation and parameter tuning for classification model

1)GridSearchCV
2)RandomizedSearchCV 

compare these two methods, randomized search CV took significantly less time.
however, the gridsearch CV returned slightly better model. (which makes sense because of the 'brute force' style search)

3)Matrix and ROC curve (for binary classification problem)
TP: 40
TN: 71
FP: 1
FN: 2
