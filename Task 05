Classification model

1) Example:
IRIS dataset
step 1: feature selection
setp 2: select criteria for model selection

2) Criteria:
In the classificatio problem, we want to know how well the model perform on each classification group.
TP/TN/FP/FN

Accuracy: What's the percentage of the 'corrected classified' sample? (For this criteria, the numerator is all "True" groups (true positive and true negative), the denominator is all the sample)

PREï¼šIn terms of the predicted positive sample, how many are correctly classified? (The denominator is all the 'PREDICTED Positive group' TP, FP)

recall: In terms of th real positive sample, how many are correctly classified? (The denominator is all the 'Positive sample', TP, FN - should be positive, but falsely classified as negative)

ROC: y-axis to be NP, x-axis to be TP, the area under the curver. The larger the area, the better the model.

3) Models:

Logistic Regression:
Change the linear regression result to fall into the interval ot [0,1]
