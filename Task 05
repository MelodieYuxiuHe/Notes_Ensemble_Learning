Classification model

1) Example:
IRIS dataset
step 1: feature selection
setp 2: select criteria for model selection

2) Criteria:
In the classificatio problem, we want to know how well the model perform on each classification group.
TP/TN/FP/FN

Accuracy: What's the percentage of the 'corrected classified' sample? (For this criteria, the numerator is all "True" groups (true positive and true negative), the denominator is all the sample)

PRE：In terms of the predicted positive sample, how many are correctly classified? (The denominator is all the 'PREDICTED Positive group' TP, FP)

recall: In terms of th real positive sample, how many are correctly classified? (The denominator is all the 'Positive sample', TP, FN - should be positive, but falsely classified as negative)

ROC: y-axis to be NP, x-axis to be TP, the area under the curver. The larger the area, the better the model.

3) Models:

Logistic Regression:
Change the linear regression result to fall into the interval ot [0,1] - logistic function

Classification model based on probability:
3.1) Linear classification:
Bayesian Rule: prior distribution
dimension reduction: we hope after performing the dimension reduction, the variance within a group can be small AND the varianc across group can be large

3.2) Naive Bayes
Assumption: no correlation between features 
it simplified the problem, but popular in practice （e.g. news classification, span classification)

Decision Tree:
'Most frequent class'
